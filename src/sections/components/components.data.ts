    description: [
      "An AND gate is a fundamental digital logic gate whose output becomes HIGH only when all of its inputs are HIGH.",
      "AND gates are used extensively in control logic, decision-making circuits, arithmetic circuits, and digital systems.",
    ],

    intuition:
      "Think of an AND gate as a system where every condition must be satisfied. If even one input is LOW, the output becomes LOW.",

    tips: [
